    Re: Albert Momo university application
</strong><br><br> <hr> <br>
Dear Mr.Momo,<br><br> Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Starz University's science faculty 
to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one
 by one in the following sections.<br><br><strong>Starting dates</strong><br><br>
 We are happy to accommodate you starting your studdy with us at any time, however it would suit 
 us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each
 one are as follows:<br><br> First semester: 9 October 2022<br>Second semester:
   15 January 2023<br>Third semester: 2 May 2023<br> Please let me know if this is ok, and
    of so which start date you would prefer.<br> You can find more information about important university dates
    on our website. <br><br></brL><strong>
        Subjects of study
    </strong> <br><br> At the Starz University, we have a pretty open
    -minded research facility &horbar; as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of 
    of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher,
    and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.Sayingg that,
     of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priorith: 
     turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wwiine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.) Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>0</sup>C(86<sup>0</sup>F), When the audience size exponentially increases (effedt of 3 * 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>.)<br><br>HtML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.<br><br>So pleade can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else yu think we'd need to know? Thanks.<br><br><strong>Exotic dance moves</strong><br><br>Yes, you are uright! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br><br>
     <dl>
        <dt>
            Ploynesian chicken dance
        </dt>
        <dd>
     A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chikens, to encourage their livestock to be"fruitful".
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Icelandic brownian shuffle
        </dt><dd>
            Before the Icelanders diviloped fire as a meand of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid jovements. Ene of my fellow students used to say thet he thought this dance inspired modern sthles such as Twerking.
        </dd><dt>
            Arctic robot dance 
        </dt><dd>
            An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characteriized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.
        </dd>
